Code to support Pearson/OReilly Live Training:"First Steps in Machine Learning: Misfit Models and Fixes"

If you are here to download the course resources, (1) click the "Code"
button (which is a little bit up and right -- it might be colored
green).  Then, (2) select "Download Zip".  

You should then have the zip
file downloaded to your computer.  Unzip it (I recommend doing that on
your Desktop for easy access) and you should be good to go!
